# Meal Plan Tracker (version 1)

## Main Idea:

Enter the current money in your meal plan and how much you spend daily. Then, the program will either tell you that you're fine, or that you will run out of money before the last day of school. If the second case occurs, it will then estimate the date that your meal plan will finish and suggest an amount to spend everyday in order to avoid having to add your own money.
